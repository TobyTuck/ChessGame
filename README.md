This project is part of my S.T.E.M. Train scholarship Project from Arizona State University and the 
national Science Foundation. This project will consist of a Java program that will be a single-player
chess game. A future goal of mine is to make this a multiplayer chess AI game that is capable of
beating me in chess.
