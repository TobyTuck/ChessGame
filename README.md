<h1>Pragmatic Chess</h1>

<h3>This project is part of my S.T.E.M. Train Scholarship Project from Arizona State University and 
the National Science Foundation. This project will consist of a multiplayer-player chess game, 
that verifies all moves made by either player.</h3>

<h2>A short breakdown of the class types: </h2><br/>
<ol>
    <li>Chessboard - provides a simple GUI that displays a chess board to its users</li>
    <li>MyMouseAdapter - handles any MouseEvents, such as mouse clicks or drags, and interprets them
                        to the lower programs</li>
    <li>[chess piece png file] - chess piece image that represents the piece on the board</li>
    <li>[chess piece].java - a sub program that represents each type of chess piece, and are 
                            responsible for handling piece moves, image types, etc</li>
        <ul>
            <li>all of these sub programs inherit from the 'ChessPiece' sub program, which provide
                common fields and methods used by all pieces, especially for determing the validity 
                of piece moves</li>

<h3>Feel free to send a pull request for this program if you would like to run it yourself </h3><br/>
